Project is basically based on Software Simulation through Proteus 8 professional tool. 
Components used are LDR sensor, Buck Converter, Optocoupler, Arduino Simulino UNO, LCD. LDR sensor will sense the light intensity and then its calculation will be
done on Arduino. According to the valuable range we can switch the charging port. Like, when intensity is high then it will charge through solar panel otherwise
Dc power supply. 
Microcontroller is connected with LCD, Light sensor, Solar Panel. First, we are calculating the voltage output from solar panel and then we are checking for 
maximum output by the intensity of the sun through the LDR. Practically it is observed that during morning it is below 400 and in good sunshine it is in the 
range of the 800 which is a good value and in the no sun time it is below 100. If the intensity observed is good the Electrical vehicle is charged through 
panel else it will check the sensor status and will charge through direct DC supply.
